Frontend design review and refinement for production interfaces.

This skill vendors the focused review/refinement subset of `pbakaus/impeccable` under the easier name `design`. The underlying detector CLI is still `npx impeccable`; do not rename that package command.

## Invocation

Use one of these forms:

- Claude Code: `/design audit src/app`
- Codex: `$design audit src/app`
- Natural language: "Use design polish on this settings page."

The first word after `design` is the subcommand. If no subcommand is provided, show the command menu below and ask which pass the user wants.

## Setup

Before design work or file edits:

1. Run the context loader if this is the first design pass in the session:

   ```bash
   node .agents/skills/design/scripts/load-context.mjs
   ```

   Consume the full JSON output. Do not pipe it through `head`, `tail`, `grep`, or `jq`.
2. If `PRODUCT.md` or `DESIGN.md` exists, use it as context. If either is missing, proceed from the codebase and user request; do not block on creating new docs.
3. Identify the surface as either `brand` or `product`:
   - `brand`: marketing, landing, campaign, portfolio, content where design is the product.
   - `product`: apps, dashboards, tools, forms, settings, operational UI where design serves repeated use.
4. Load the matching register reference: [reference/brand.md](reference/brand.md) or [reference/product.md](reference/product.md).
5. If a subcommand is provided, load its reference file and follow it.

## Shared Rules

- Avoid generic AI-looking UI: gradient text, decorative glass cards, identical card grids, hero-metric templates, and category-reflex palettes.
- Do not default to dark or light mode by category. Choose from the actual usage scene.
- Use layout, type, spacing, color, and motion deliberately. No decoration that does not clarify or improve the experience.
- For product UI, prefer dense but calm, scannable, repeatable workflows over marketing composition.
- For brand UI, make the product, object, or offer visible in the first viewport and avoid generic decorative backgrounds.
- Treat text overflow, i18n, long labels, empty states, loading states, and error states as design requirements, not afterthoughts.
- Make findings concrete and actionable. For review passes, lead with issues and file references when available.

## Commands

| Command | Use When | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| `audit [target]` | Accessibility, performance, responsive behavior, theming, and technical design-quality checks | [reference/audit.md](reference/audit.md) |
| `critique [target]` | UX review, visual hierarchy, information architecture, cognitive load, and heuristic scoring | [reference/critique.md](reference/critique.md) |
| `polish [target]` | Final pass for alignment, spacing, consistency, and shipping-quality details | [reference/polish.md](reference/polish.md) |
| `harden [target]` | Error states, i18n, text overflow, real-world data, and edge-case resilience | [reference/harden.md](reference/harden.md) |
| `layout [target]` | Spacing, rhythm, alignment, composition, density, and hierarchy problems | [reference/layout.md](reference/layout.md) |
| `typeset [target]` | Typography, font choice, hierarchy, sizing, weight, and readability | [reference/typeset.md](reference/typeset.md) |
| `colorize [target]` | Gray, dull, or under-committed UI that needs strategic color | [reference/colorize.md](reference/colorize.md) |
| `clarify [target]` | UX copy, labels, instructions, empty states, and error messages | [reference/clarify.md](reference/clarify.md) |
| `distill [target]` | Simplifying, decluttering, removing noise, and focusing the UI | [reference/distill.md](reference/distill.md) |

## Routing

1. If the first word matches a command above, load that command's reference and use the rest of the prompt as the target.
2. If the first word does not match, treat the whole prompt as a general design request and choose the closest command. State the chosen command briefly.
3. Only recommend follow-up commands from the supported list above.
4. End heavy implementation passes with `polish` only when the user explicitly wants fixes applied after the initial review.

## Pin / Unpin

Pinned shortcuts are optional. They create lightweight skill aliases such as `audit` that redirect to `design audit`.

```bash
node .agents/skills/design/scripts/pin.mjs <pin|unpin> <command>
```

Valid commands are: `audit`, `critique`, `polish`, `harden`, `layout`, `typeset`, `colorize`, `clarify`, `distill`.
